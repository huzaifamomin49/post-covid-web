                  <div style="margin:10px;font-family:calibri;font-size:20px" class="text-justify">The “social economy” has played an important role in addressing and mitigating the short- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on economy and society. In the short term, social economy actors have assisted the recovery from the crisis by providing innovative solutions that are aimed at strengthening public services to complement government action. In the long term, social economy organisations can help reshape the post-crisis economy by promoting inclusive and sustainable economic models. Relying on decades of experience, its specific features and underlying principles, the social economy can inspire models of social innovation and a sense of purpose to firms operating in the market economy.

                    <div style="margin:2%;font-family:calibri;font-size:20px" class="text-justify">While the COVID-19 pandemic is constantly growing and showing little signs of containment as of 15 April 2020, its adverse impact on economic growth of the country will probably be very serious. The UN warned that the coronavirus pandemic is expected to have a significant adverse impact on global economy, and most significantly, GDP growth of India for the present economy is projected to decline to 4.8 per cent (United Nation 2020). Similarly, the UN ‘Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) 2020 reported that COVID-19 would have extensive socio-economic consequences in the region with inundate activities across borders in the areas of tourism, trade and financial linkages (United Nations, 2020).

About 400 million people (76.2% of the total workforce) working in the informal economy in India are at a risk of falling deeper into poverty due to catastrophic consequences of the virus. As half of the world is in lockdown, it is going to be a loss of 195 million full-time jobs or 6.7 per cent of working hours globally. Many are in low-paid, low-skilled jobs where sudden loss of income is catastrophic (International Labour Organisation, 2020).

                    While estimates vary, across EU28 countries, there exist 2.8 million traditional social economy organisations (SEOs), employing about 6.3% of the EU workforce (or 13.6 million jobs) according to CIRIEC (2017).

                    The diversity of definitions and legal frameworks, as well as different methods of data collection, makes cross-country comparisons of the weight and contribution of the social economy difficult. The economic importance of the social economy in terms of contribution to GDP is difficult to capture as many of its activities are not reflected in GDP and require other indicators to measure its impact. Besides, there is no one globally used definition but social economy organisations traditionally refer to the set of associations, cooperatives, mutual organisations, and foundations whose activity is driven by values of solidarity, the primacy of people over capital, and democratic and participatory governance (OECD, 2018[7]). As a consequence, some countries only measure these organisations, without capturing social enterprises, while others collect very detailed datasets capturing all social economy organisations including social enterprises which may fall outside of the traditional social economy definition. The significant data gap for various countries can be partly explained by the vastly different definitions of social economy organisations, as well as reflecting various levels of acceptance or recognition and understanding of the social economy across countries (CIRIEC, 2017).<br><br>
                    <b style="background-color:orange">Box 2. Masques-Coronavirus.Brussels: bringing together different social economy practices</b><br>
                    Masques-Coronavirus.Brussels is one example of a social economy initiative that brought rapid solutions to pressing problems during the COVID-19 crisis. In the face of personnel protective equipment shortages, two social enterprises from Brussels, EcoRes and Travie, joined forces to meet the urgent demand for masks for frontline health care personnel. EcoRes is a sustainable innovation lab specialised in the circular economy, which co-ordinated the project, while Travie is a work integration social enterprise that employs people with disabilities. With the support of the Brussels-Capital Region, a collaborative and decentralised production line of masks was established. Students from a professional fashion design school designed the mask pattern and conducted a tutorial on the design; mask kits were pre-cut and prepared by Travie; and the kits were delivered by the social enterprise Urbike to a network of volunteering citizens who sewed the masks according to quality standards. More than 2 000 people were involved and produced 240 000 reusable masks for frontline caregivers in 1.5 months</p>
